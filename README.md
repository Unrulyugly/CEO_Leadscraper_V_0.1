Project Overview


This CEO Name Extractor is a powerful tool designed to automate the process of finding the names of CEOs or equivalent positions (such as Founders) for given companies. It leverages advanced web scraping techniques via seper-api and natural language understanding through LangChain Expression Language combined with OpenAI's embeddings to extract relevant information from a variety of sources. This project simplifies the task of gathering executive information for businesses listed in a text file, particularly useful for market researchers, journalists, and business analysts.
